**Last Updated: November 29, 2025**

## Introduction

MatrixLabs Wallet ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Collect
MatrixLabs Wallet is a **non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet**. We collect and store the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Encrypted Wallet Data**: Your encrypted private keys, seed phrases, and account information
- **Wallet Settings**: Network preferences, selected accounts, and UI preferences
- **Transaction History**: Records of your blockchain transactions (stored locally)

### What We DO NOT Collect
- We do NOT collect any personal information
- We do NOT track your browsing activity
- We do NOT collect your IP address
- We do NOT send any data to our servers (we don't have any servers)
- We do NOT share your data with third parties

## How We Use Your Data

All data is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's storage API:
- **Encrypted Storage**: Your private keys are encrypted with your password using AES-256 encryption
- **Local Only**: No data ever leaves your device to our servers
- **User Control**: You have full control over your data and can delete it at any time by removing the extension

## Third-Party Services

### Blockchain RPC Providers
To interact with blockchain networks, the extension connects to public RPC endpoints:
- Ethereum Mainnet: Public RPC providers (e.g., Infura, Alchemy)
- Other Networks: Public RPC endpoints for Polygon, Sepolia, etc.

**Important**: When you send transactions, your wallet address and transaction data are sent to these RPC providers and recorded on the public blockchain. This is necessary for blockchain functionality and is not controlled by us.

### DApp Interactions
When you connect to decentralized applications (DApps):
- The DApp can see your wallet address (only if you approve the connection)
- Transaction requests are shown to you for approval before being sent
- You have full control over what data is shared with each DApp

## Data Security

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data (private keys, seed phrases) is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption
- **Password Protection**: Your wallet is protected by a password that only you know
- **No Server Storage**: We never store your data on any server
- **Open Source**: Our code is open source and can be audited on GitHub

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Access**: View all data stored by the extension in Chrome's developer tools
- **Delete**: Remove all data by uninstalling the extension
- **Control**: Choose which DApps can access your wallet address
- **Export**: Export your seed phrase to use in other wallets
